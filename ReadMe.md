# Project "Winforms SQL PwHash 2"

A more advanced version of "Project Winforms" using a login window and the ability to add more users based on user credentials (hard coded for now).
Includes bCrypt for salting and hashing of passwords.<br>
You will also need to add a 'user' table to the DB using the enclosed CreateUserTable.sql

This is the Visual Studio "version" of Winforms_SQL_PwHash. Includes menu and About box & logfile routine.
