## How to clone a repo (Thanks John Kristian Ellingsen):

- Goto your own GitHub
- Click the New button
- Click the "import a repository" link
- Paste the repo link you'd like to import
- Choose name (or just use the repo link as the name)
- Choose visibility
- Wait a bit (or a lot depending on processing power)
- Do the usual "git clone "URL link".git in VS Code/Visual Studio
